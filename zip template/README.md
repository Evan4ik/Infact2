# Endless Act 2

Adds a new endless dungeon to the starting island in act 2! How far can you go?<br />
The game gets progressively more difficult as it goes on, with special hazards being added to some of the elite battles, and rare cards spawning more often.

If you have any feedback (i.e bug reports or suggestions), I WILL find them. Don't worry. :)
